function [xopt, fopt, exitflag, output] = inner_direct_search(fun, ...
    xopt, fopt, D, direction_indices, alpha, options)
%INNER_DIRECT_SEARCH performs a single iteration of classical direct search 
%   within a given block.
%
%   xopt = INNER_DIRECT_SEARCH(FUN, xopt, fopt, D, DIRECTION_INDICES, ALPHA, OPTIONS)
%   returns an xopt.
%
%   xopt = INNER_DIRECT_SEARCH(FUN, xopt, fopt, D, ...
%   DIRECTION_INDICES, ALPHA, OPTIONS) works with the structure OPTIONS, which includes
%   reduction_factor, ftarget, polling, with_cycling_memory, cycling.
%
%   [xopt, fopt] = INNER_DIRECT_SEARCH(...) returns the value of the objective function fopt 
%   at xopt.
%
%   [xopt, fopt, EXITFLAG] = INNER_DIRECT_SEARCH(...) returns an EXITFLAG that describes 
%   the exit condition.
%
%   [xopt, fopt, EXITFLAG, OUTPUT] = INNER_DIRECT_SEARCH(...) returns a structure OUTPUT including
%   funcCount, fhist, xhist, success, terminate, and direction_indices.
%
%   TERMINATE is initialized to be false. If terminate is updated to be true,
%   it means that either the number of function evaluations reaches MaxFunctionEvaluations, or ftarget is reached.
%
%   DIRECTION_INDICES is the indices of directions of this block in D.
%

% Set the value of sufficient decrease factor.
reduction_factor = options.reduction_factor;

% Set target of objective function.
ftarget = options.ftarget;

% Set the value of polling_inner. This is the polling strategy employed within one block.

% Set the value of cycling_inner, which represents the cycling strategy inside each block.
cycling_strategy = options.cycling_inner;

% Set the boolean value of WITH_CYCLING_MEMORY.

% Set the forcing function, which is a function handle.

% The number of function evaluations allocated to this function.

% Explain why NaN is good. It is possible that this function returns
% with exitflag=NaN and this is NOT a bug. This is because other situations
% correspond to other normal values. Easy to see whether there is some bug 
% related to exitflag.

    % In the opportunistic case, if the current iteration achieves sufficient decrease,
    % stop the computations after cycling the indices of the polling directions. The reason  
    % why we cycle indices here is because inner_direct_search is called in a loop in outer_direct_search.

% When the algorithm reaches here, it means that there are three cases.
% 1. The algorithm uses out of the allocated function evaluations.
% 2. The algorithm reaches the target function value.
% 3. The algorithm achieves sufficient decrease.
